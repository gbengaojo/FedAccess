# Building a Capabilities Statement
[Youtube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=y3kMBgk9svw)

### Elements
* Name, Logo
* Company Summary
* Core Capabilities
* Differentiators
* Certifications (SBA and other government designations, specifically)
* NAICS Codes
* References
* DUNS, CAGE codes
* Contact Info

Should be one side of one page -- Recommend a master copy and then tailoring for each agency, project or proposal.

Best practice is to save it with the companies name in the file name as a PDF.

Make it available on your website.

Use bullet points.

### Company Summary
Emphasizing what your company has to offer to the target audience

### Core Capabilities
List services offered as they relate to the specific needs of the target audience

### Differentiators
Explain what makes your business stand out from the rest (years in business, prior government work, security clearances, etc)

### Certifications
HUBZonse, WOSB, any relevant contract vehicles (e.g., GSA contracts)

### NAICS Codes
The government agencies specify their contract opportunities using NAICS codes. The same work can be put out using different codes. List every code that could apply for the specific contract (3 - 5, maybe 7)

### References / Past Performance
Commercial or government clients. Focus on specific experience that relates to the target project. Describe the type of work performed, the size, the duration, possibly contact information for references. If not federal agencies, list prior work done relating to the contract

Logos of clients instead are ok

### DUNS, CAGE codes
List these b/c a company has a CAGE code only if registered in SAM.gov. This shows the purchasing agency that you're registered to do business with the government

### Contact Information
List a specific person's name, their direct phone and email, and the company website as a link

Gather all of the necessary elements, then lay them out on a single page in an easily readable manner

For examples, google "Capability Statement" then click on "Images"

There are Cabaility Statements available for purchase online

Don't use long paragraphs. Use bullets, whitespace, appealing color schemes and appropriate imagery. Use a font large enough to be readable
