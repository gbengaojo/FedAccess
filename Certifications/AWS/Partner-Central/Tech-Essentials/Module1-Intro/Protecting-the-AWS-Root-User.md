# Protecting the AWS Root User

## AWS Root User Credentials
* Two (2) sets are provided
  * 1. email & password
  * 2. access keys that allow programmatic API access

Access Keys consist of two parts:
  * **Access key ID:** for example, A2lAl5EXAMPLE
  * **Secret access key:** for example, wJalrFE/KbEKxE

> Similar to a user name and password combination, you need both the access key ID and secret access key to authenticate your requests through the AWS CLI or AWS API. Access keys should be managed with the same security as an email address and password.
