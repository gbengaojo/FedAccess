== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= What are the plugin requirements? =

Featured Articles requires at least WordPress 3.0.1 and a modern web browser. No support for IE8 or below.

= How does support and updates work? =

that wise men answered a thousand years ago. Working from home meant we could vary snack and coffee breaks, change our desks or view, goof off, drink on the job, even spend the day in pajamas, and often meet to gossip or share ideas. On the other hand, we bossed ourselves around, set impossible goals, and demanded longer hours than office jobs usually entail. It was the ultimate 'flextime' in that it depended on how flexible we felt each day, given deadlines, distractions, and workaholic crescendos.

= Can I upgrade after the initial purchase? =

Yes. License upgrading is quite easy. After your initial purchase, if you want to ugrade, visit this page. All prices will be discounted based on the initial purchase that you made.

Yes, just post the following syntax in any post / page: [Juna_Photo_Slider id="xxx"], where 'xxx' is the ID.
