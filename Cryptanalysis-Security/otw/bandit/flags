4wcYUJFw0k0XLShlDzztnTBHiqxU3b3e this one was totally stupid; instead of ssh -i <keyfile> banidt14@bandit.labs.overthewire.org, it's ssh -i <keyfile> bandit14@localhost. Got everything except the localhost (this machine). Ugh.; Update (next day); the -i flag works fine if the private key is used. If the public key (freshly derived from the private key using ssh-keygen -y...) is used, the passphrase is asked (which I don't know) 3 times, then the password (which was obtained from /etc/bandit_pass/bandit14, per instructions), then login is successful. The generation of a new public key is not needed for level 13 -> 14.
